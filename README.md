Summary:
This tutorial demonstrates how to change the behavior of Traktor Pro so that one-shots are
re-triggered ever time you hit a remix slot button (in remix mode). This is done through a
custom mapping that can be downloaded from the link above.

The default behavior of the remix slot button (in remix mode) is to play the sample when
hitting button initially and then stopping the sample when hitting the button again. This
results in the user having to hit the remix slot button twice in order to play a sample once.

Additionally, this mapping adds other usability improvements to the Kontrol S2 MK2 such as
activating Freeze mode and selecting samples directly from the controller. 


Version tested using: 
Traktor Pro 2.8.1
Traktor Kontrol S2 MK2 (Firmware 68)
